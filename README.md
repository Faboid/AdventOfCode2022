# Solutions for Advent Of Code 2022.

To use, execute the console application and input the day of the problem. The public test input will be used as default.

If you want to use custom inputs, add them to the assembly AdventOfCode2022.Core at /Properties/ with the format Day{DayNumber}Input.txt and set them as embedded resources.
To then execute those custom inputs, use "{day} real" as a command to the console.

To stop the application, input the "exit" command instead of the day.
